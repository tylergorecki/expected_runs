UVA Statistics Capstone Project<br>

## Project Overview

This is the repository summarizing our work during the UVA Fall 2023 semester. We built a model that simulates each pitch of a half-inning, generating typical baseball outcomes and returning the number of runs scored, given an input of many unique count/baserunner/lineup/outs situations. Most of our research during this project consisted of building the model and performing lineup analysis. 

Our final submissions include a deliverable that we would give to a front office outlining why we would want to spend more time/resources on a project like this and a final presentation breaking down our work for the semester.
