## Project Overview

This is the repository summarizing our work during the 2023 fall semester. We built a model that simulates each pitch of a half-inning, generating typical baseball outcomes and returning the number of runs scored, given an input of many unique count/baserunner/lineup/outs situations. Most of our research during this project consisted of building the model and performing lineup analysis.
